# Herd

*Herd* is a repository for Australian COVID-19 data ingestion and analysis via a data cube API. The data is interactively displayed on a dashboard available at [https://herd-covid19-dashboard-web.herokuapp.com/#/](https://herd-covid19-dashboard-web.herokuapp.com/#/).

The repository hosts the data ingestion pipeline from data sources, the [Cube.js](https://cube.dev/docs/) analytical API, and the React dashboard application. Documentation is available within each individual folder.
